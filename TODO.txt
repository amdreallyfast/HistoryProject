	Add to mouse state. 
	Derived from cursorRayCastIntersections if the first item is a pin bounding box.
	Highlight on hover (??how to differentiate between hover and selected??)

When pin is selected:
	8/10/2024
	1. Move "selected location Id" from the "edit state" into the mouse state because this will be used outside of editing too.
	2. Scroll the list of location Ids in the Details view (if shown)

Standardize function console log messages:
	??jan 2024??
	8/10/2024
	console.log({ "class.function": argumentValue })
	console.log({ "class.useEffect[condition]": conditionValue })
