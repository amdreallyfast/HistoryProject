hoverLocationId:
	8/10/2024
	Add to mouse state. 
	Derived from cursorRayCastIntersections if the first item is a pin bounding box.
	Highlight on hover (??how to differentiate between hover and selected??)

When pin is selected:
	8/10/2024
	1. Move "selected location Id" from the "edit state" into the mouse state because this will be used outside of editing too.
	2. Scroll the list of location Ids in the Details view (if shown)

Standardize function console log messages:
	??jan 2024??
	8/10/2024
	console.log({ "class.function": argumentValue })
	console.log({ "class.useEffect[condition]": conditionValue })

Fix ear clipping that blows up when you drag an edge too far out of the circle:
	8/10/2024
	Maybe switch direction of evaluation when it's about to do that?
	Somehow stop movement of a pin such that it inverts the triangle?

Update mouse hover to allow for things other than pin bounding boxes
	8/10/2024
	??How to identify though? A region doesn't have a locationId, so what to do??
