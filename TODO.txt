change color on hover:
	8/10/2024
	Add to mouse state. 
	(done 8/10/2024) Derived from cursorRayCastIntersections if the first item is a pin bounding box.
	(done 8/10/2024) Highlight on hover (??how to differentiate between hover and selected??)

When pin is selected:
	8/10/2024
	(done 8/10/2024) 1. Move "selected location Id" from the "edit state" into the mouse state because this will be used outside of editing too.
	(done 8/10/2024) 2. Scroll the list of location Ids in the Details view (if shown)
		htmlElement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "center" })

Bug: Selected location is de-selected any time there is a mouse down.
	(done 8/10/2024) Fixed by making selection only on mouse down and selection clear only on mouse up (and then only if it qualifies as a "click").

Standardize function console log messages:
	??jan 2024??
	8/10/2024
	console.log({ "class.function": argumentValue })
	console.log({ "class.useEffect[condition]": conditionValue })

Bug: Ear clipping blows up when you drag an edge too far out of the circle:
	8/10/2024
	Maybe switch direction of evaluation when it's about to do that?
	Somehow stop movement of a pin such that it inverts the triangle?

Update mouse hover to allow for things other than pin bounding boxes
	8/10/2024
	??How to identify though? A region doesn't have a locationId, so what to do??
