How to run a web server using Java in 2022
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gel8Q_MO3rI
Note: Learned this command:
    java -m jdk.httpserver -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8080
    This will create a basic HTTP server (with HTTPS support, should you select that port).
    Does not support "jsp" (Java Server Pages). If you specify such a file in the browser address bar, the file is simply downloaded.

    ?? is this useful to me??

	Not covered, but need to do: Create database in Azure and connect with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
		Josh Baugher guided me through.
		Azure portal 
			-> Create resource 
			-> search for "SQL" 
			-> select "Azure SQL" 
			-> Create
				"How do you plan to use the service?"
				-> SQL databases
					-> Resource type: Single database
					-> Create
						-> Basics
							-> Resource group: <select or create new>
							-> Database name
								HistoryProjectSQL-DB
							-> Server
								-> Create new
									-> Server name: "historyproject" (.database.windows.net automatically appended)
									-> Location: <default>
									-> Authentication method:
										-> Use both SQL and Azure AD authentication
											-> Set Azure AD admin
												Note: Cannot select my @hotmail.com self (Josh was confused by this), so we had me select "coxjohn-cluster" (whatever that is)
											-> Server admin login	
												historyprojectadmin
											-> Password
												TinkerTots1ForAll!
							-> Want to use SQL elastic pool?: No
							-> Compute + storage
								-> Configure database
									-> Service tier: General Purpose
									-> Compute tier: Serverless (that is, share a big VM with many others; performance not as much on demand, but much cheaper)
									-> Hardware Configuration: Gen5
									-> Max vCores: 2
									-> Min vCores: 1
									-> Auto-pause delay: 
										-> Enable auto-pause: <checked>
										-> Days: 0, Hours: 1, Minutes: 0
									-> Data max size (GB): 50
									-> Would you like to make this database zone redundant?: No
							-> Backup storage redundancy: Locally-redundant backup storage
						-> Networking
							-> Allow Azure services and resources to access this server: Yes
							-> Add current client IP address: Yes
							-> Connection policy: Default
						-> Security
							-> Enable Microsoft Defender for SQL: No
							-> Ledger
								-> Configure ledger
									-> Ledger
										-> Enable for all future tables in this database: <checked>
									--> Digest stroage
										-> Enable automatic digest storage: <not checked>
						-> Additional settings
							-> Use existing data: None
							-> Collation: <default> ("SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS")
							-> Maintenance window: <default> (5pm - 8am)
						-> Review + create
							-> Create
		
		<wait for resource creation to complete>
		
		Open resource "HistoryProjectSQL-DB (historyproject/HistoryProjectSQL-DB)"
			-> Overview
				-> copy "Server name"
		
		Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
			-> at login, use the "server name" copied ealier
			-> sign in with username and password used in "Authentication method" during the SQL database creation
